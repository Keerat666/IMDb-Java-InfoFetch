# IMDb-Java-InfoFetch
Just made a Java program to fetch the movie data from IMDb if you give the link of the movie in the code . Will very soon automate that process of generating the link from the name of the movie too. This code might help you in any movie related projects where you want to fetch data from IMDb for a jsp page . If you want any more data to be fetched than it's being already done , drop me a message at gurkeeratsondhi@gmail.com !
