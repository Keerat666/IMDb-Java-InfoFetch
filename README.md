# IMDb-Java-InfoFetch
Just made a Java program to fetch the movie data from IMDb . Compile imdb.java in your console and you will be good to go . This code might help you in any movie related projects where you want to fetch data from IMDb for a jsp page . If you want any more data to be fetched than it's being already done , drop me a message at gurkeeratsondhi@gmail.com !
